# Encryption
An utility to encrypt and decrypt files
Use "python3 encrypt.py -h" to get help
1. If you can't decrypt a file, it could be because the file isn't encrypted or you've wrote the wrong key or password.
2. While decrypting a direcory, all the files have to be encrypted, else there would be an error; file will be dercrypted up to the issue and then they'll remain encrypted
3. I've wrote in requirements.txt the library I needed to install. If you need some more libraries, check out the other libraries I used at the top of the document and install them
